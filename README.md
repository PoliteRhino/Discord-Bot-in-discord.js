# **Discord Bot in Discord.js**  
Creating a Discord bot using Discord.js, a powerful library with extensive community support. This repository provides a basic template to help you get started.  

## **Step-by-Step Guide**  
1. Open your code editor. I am using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the IDE **Cursor**.  
2. Create a new folder for your project.  
3. Open a new terminal by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + `** or by navigating to **Terminal > New Terminal**.

4. In the terminal, initialize your project by running:  
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
   OR  
   ```sh
   npm init
   ```
   *(I prefer `npm init -y` as it simplifies the process.)*  
5. Create a file named `bot.js` or `index.js`â€”this will be the main file for your bot.  
6. Before running the bot, install the necessary package and obtain your bot token.  
7. Install **Discord.js** by running:  
   ```sh
   npm install discord.js
   ```  
8. Obtain your bot token:  
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
   - Navigate to **Applications > New Application > Bot**.  
   - Click **Reset Token** and then **Copy Token**.  
9. Create a file named `config.json` to securely store your bot token.  
10. Start your bot by executing:  
   ```sh
   node bot.js
   ```
   OR  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
